To Do / Task Manager application:

Sir/Ma'am, your team forget to send me the React template project for a Todo App (As mentioned in the previous mail).
So I create the design and developed the todo.
There is no dialogue regarding the API in the email. So I create a backend server with node and express and use mongodb server
Hope you like it.

1. open the task folder in VS Code
2. open the terminal
3. cd "./todo/frontend"
4. npm i
5. npm start
6. open new terminal
7. cd "./todo/backend"
8. npm i
9. npm start or npm run backend

Weather APP:

As mentioned, I used Open Weather API to develop the frontend of the weather project

1. open new terminal
2. cd "./weather"
3. npm i
4. npm start

Hope you like my work.
Thank you for the opportunity.
